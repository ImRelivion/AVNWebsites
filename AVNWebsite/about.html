            <h3>How it all started</h3>
            <p>Well, it all should’ve started back when I played my first ever visual novel called Doki Doki literature club. The game was developed by Team Salvato and it really took the internet by storm, the game was all over youtube. I got to watching Doki Doki about a week after it became popular and soon after I started playing it. So since then, the game got stuck in the back of my mind and I didn’t know back then that this would be the reason I started getting into the whole Visual Novel genre. A few years after Doki Doki was released, I started to feel the need of finding a game similar to it, so that was when I started searching for games like it to play. It took a long time of searching but I found the game Freeloading Family due to its main background song “Night Rain by Airtone”. By searching for the name of that song I found a vid of the song naming it after the game. That led to me being curious about the game so I went out to search for information about the game. Which was then I found the AVN a game a little bit different from the genre I was wanting to get into more but that didn’t stop me from trying it since I like trying new stuff. So yea that’s how I started playing my first ever AVN.
