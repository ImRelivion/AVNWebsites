        <h3>Info</h3>
        <div class="Info-P">
            <p>Here's a brief explanation to cover what an Adult visual novel (AVN) is. Well an AVN is a type of game genre, which revolves around a text-based story that is built upon picture renders and animations. The games are heavily texted based, so it’s like reading a picture book of sorts, however in this picture book you got some power to change the path that lies ahead. The trivial changes occur via how you act, or what you choose to say at the moment. Something i forgot to mention is that each and every game gives out a tutorial to help every person to get into the game as smooth as possible.</p>

                <p>Freeloading Family is a game created by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/FFCreations">FFCreations</a>, the game is based around the main character who’s been moving around from base to base following his military father. However by the point when you the mc turned 18, your father had decided to let you live in his house back home, with your childhood friend/step-sister (depending on what you chose). It all seemed too good to be true, having a pre-paid house of your own and living with your childhood friend while also finally enrolling in a school that you won’t have to leave after a few months. Unfortunately, your strict father has decided that you have to man up and get a job to pay the bills for the house. Thus putting you in a spot where you need to find a way to juggle school, finding a job while also finding time to spend with your newfound “friends”.</p>

                    Freeloading Family serves as a great foundation for people who wanna get into the scene of AVN’s. The renders and the story that we the player follow are undoubtedly well made. However, for the start of the game, the renders are of lesser quality, which is rather common in most cases of the early stages of AVN’s. But worry not the quality rises quite quickly. The story is easy to follow. I would say the game is really well made but not the best, so that is why it’s a great start. This is why starting with Freeloading Family is better than starting with the best because that will only put the bar too high.

                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>
                    Being a DIK is a creation by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/DrPinkCake">Dr PinkCake</a>. The creator has also made the game Acting lessons and it is quite well known in the visual novel community due to its great storytelling. The same goes for its successor Being a DIK, it all starts with the prologue that leads up to the main event, which is the MC’s college days. The prologue starts just before the main character finds out about being accepted into a college named B&R. Being accepted into college meant he could quit his shitty summer job at the convenience store. While watching the prologue unfold we come to learn that the mc lives alone with his father, due to his mother being deceased. Thus we come to learn that his father plays a big role in the MC life, and is one of the reasons he’ll even attend college at all. That being said the story is based around the MC’s college days where he tries to make the most out of them, but instead he gets caught up in joining a frat house and now we need to guide him through his eventful life, tho be careful every action affects how every character approaches/views you.

                         <p>
                          In my opinion, Being a DIK is one of the best AVN’s I’ve played. You truly always have something to do in the game and the side things to unlock renders are always fun. The renders quality are high quality throughout the story so far. However, there are right now only 2 seasons released, but getting through those 2 seasons takes a lot of time, due to its large quantity of content. So right now the story is intriguing, and the options that carry a heavy impact on the rest of the game are well set up, and you always know when they occur. The character interactions and the plot is so well made that you always come back for more. You truly notice how much effort has been put into each and every character that the game introduces.

                <p>
                 Double Homework was made by Love-Joint. The story of Double Homework is surrounding the main character who’s going through a tough time in his life due to past events that occurred during his training for skiing in the Olympics. However, he lives together with two girls that you can choose what connection they have to you. So the story will follow the MC trying to break the bad cycles that he’s fallen into.  Whilst he’s also attending summer school to catch up with his studies. During the story, you encounter 6 main female characters that you come to know and connect deeply with, which in the end you will have to choose one of them to continue your relationship with, so who will you choose in the end?

                        <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lovejoint">Love-Joint</a> has made a wonderful game with a story that is easy to follow whilst being well made with probably one of the best quality renders I have stumbled upon during my time playing AVN’s, that looks highly well made. The character’s personalities really show that Love-Joint has put a ton of time and effort to make each one of their interactions feel personal. Something about this AVN that may pique your interest is that the game is completed so you don’t have to wait for the updates to get released. This AVN is great for newcomers and veterans to play, it is a perfect fit for the genre since you truly feel for everything that is occurring during the story. You truly can’t stop playing the game since the story really pulls you in.

                         <p>A.O.A Academy was made by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TLGGAMES">TLG Games</a>, In A.O.A Academy we start out by following the prologue of the MC who’s been living at a farm in a place called the “Old Town”  with his ill father. In the prologue, we get to learn that his mother died shortly after giving birth to him and since he has been living alone with his father. We also find out that the MC abandoned his own dreams just to stay and help his ill father at the farm, even though his father keeps on insisting that he should leave and live his own life. So during one day, the MC finds an acceptance letter for a college called A.O.A Academy, that his father had hidden to surprise him with. So now we get to follow the main character’s school days, which doesn’t stay “Normal” like had hoped they would. There is also a fun small feature that exists, which is that there are hidden renders in the background which we have to look carefully to see so we can unlock them. It’s a small but simple thing that rewards the players who pay extra attention to the game.

                         <p>My thoughts surrounding A.O.A Academy are that the game is super well made to the point where I’m having a hard time getting through the game since I can’t choose which character to go for. Since their personalities are so well made and if you choose one over the other you will see the other characters hurt in some shape or form. We can’t also overlook the great music as well as the qualities of the renders. The music is almost as good as Being a DIK’s soundtrack in my opinion. So I would like to recommend this game for people who have already played at least 1 or 2 AVN’s before, just so the bar doesn’t get put too high. Nonetheless, the game is also great for veterans and folks who play more casually.
